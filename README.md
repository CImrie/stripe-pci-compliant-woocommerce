# Stripe WooCommerce Payment Gateway Plugin

PCI Compliant WooCommerce Plugin - Original Credit to nazrulhassanmca for the plugin, which I have adapted to be 100% PCI Compliant

This is a Stripe WooCommerce Payment Gateway Plugin. All rights to the original codebase lie with nazrulhassanmca and so you should always check with him for any modifications and cite where possible.
Only PCI-related changes have been made by myself and should be credited to me where possible.

## This was released as nazrulhassanmca had not updated the main plugin (see here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pretty-shocking-error-all-of-your-users-could-be-operating-illegally?replies=7#post-7947580)

# Please note that the original plugin has now been updated.
